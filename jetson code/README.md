# Jetson Code

This is the place you would add all the processing you wanted to do.
Jetcard has deep learning libraries installed; so you can go ahead,
remove the code that makes the robot go north, and replace it with code
that commands the rover to do stuff based on image processing, sound processing,
video processing, signal processing, HAM radio processing....go crazy!
